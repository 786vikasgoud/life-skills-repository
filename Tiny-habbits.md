* I like the formula B = MAT and its graph.
* B (Behavior): This represents the behavior you want to change.
* MAT (Motivation, Ability, Trigger): These are the three factors that influence your ability to make the desired behavior change.
* It tells that motivation may not stand for long by using tiny habits one can move forward and change the behaviour for long. Triggers a play a role.
# 2.How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?
* M - Motivation.
* A - Ability.
* P - Prompt.
* Big habits might seem hard to stick to, but you can make them easier by turning them into tiny habits. Just attach them to things you already do. For example, say, 'After I brush my teeth, I will floss one tooth.' Small steps can lead to big successes, and they're easier to keep up with every day.
# 3.Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

* Creating habits involves four stages:
* First, you notice what needs to be done. Then, you want to make a change. Doing is the action part, where you need to start over and optimize your starting point.

# 8.Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
* I want to make a habit of solving three coding questions related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). To do this, I will use platforms like LeetCode that have daily streaks to help me stay consistent.
* I plan to join active social media groups to stay motivated and share my progress. Additionally, I will explain what I've learned to interested friends to reinforce my understanding.
